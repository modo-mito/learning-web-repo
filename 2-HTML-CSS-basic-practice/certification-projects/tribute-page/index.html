        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For over a decade now i have watched anime shows. Here's a brief explanation of the things that i like about them.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>People come together to celebrate and establish relationships, with anime as the first topic of common interest.</p>
        <h3>Range of Expression</h3>
        <p>It is weird, it is bold, it is compelling. With each expressed emotion the  richer it gets. </p>
        <h3>Depth</h3>
        <p>People love anime because they can identify with the challenges and peculiarities of the characters.</p>
        <h2>Media</h2>
        <p>Anime being a rendered medium allows fantasy to come to life and the expression of anything is only limited by imagination.</p>
        <h3>Variation</h3>
        <p>Even in stories that technically have a lot in common it is always possible to have a different flavor, the themes are always refreshing through the style.</p>
        <h3>Length</h3>
        <p>Twenty minutes and the episode is over. It's great because it usually doesn't drag too long and you don't get tired.
Directors and authors can design the plot so that you feel like something has been accomplished and then add a hook to make you want to watch the next one.</p>
        <h2>Market</h2>
        <p>Competition drives creativity and the power of the Internet allows for accessibility through fair means while also fueling the industry with money. The Internet also gives authors the opportunity to have a place to show what they can do and then be chosen to have an anime.</p>
        <h3>Variety</h3>
        <p>Challenges and miracles. Love and war. Heroes without powers, villains that do good. Look for it and you will understand, there is always something different enough to please almost every niche.</p>
        <h3>Catalog</h3>
        <p>There's always more, each season dozens of new worlds to experience. If you like watching all the episodes at once, there are already hundreds of good anime that are worth it, and dozens that would leave you truly impressed with what the authors can imagine and achieve. </p>
