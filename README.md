# learning-web-repo
Repository to contain most code produced during my relearning of the basics of web technologies.

inspired by: [Roadmap Frontend 2023](https://github.com/gabrielrangel95/roadmap-front-2023)
I have resumed the following sequence to study and will organize this repo similarly to help navigation.
As i develop my skills this overview will change.

###### 1. JavaScript
  simple exercises to learn the specifics of the language 

###### 2. HTML+CSS
  most are pages created from mockups found in the intenet
  
###### 3. Web Trio
  simple web systems that use HTML, CSS and JavaScript

###### 4. React.js
  to be decided if i will keep more complex project in this repo or on their own.
